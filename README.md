 ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
 
Application Design and Function
As a web development student I want a tutorial explaining a specific regex
so that I can understand the search pattern the regex defines


 # My Task and Application Requirments

  - GIVEN a regex tutorial when I open the tutorial I want see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph   
    explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile

  - WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents then I am taken to the corresponding sections of the   
    tutorial.

  - WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial then I find a detailed explanation of what a specific      
    component of the regex does

  - WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial then I find a section about the author and a 
    link to the author’s GitHub profile

  
## [Anchors](#table-of-contents)
 -  The Anchors are always at the begining and end of the string. For the example above, ^ is the symbol for the 
    begining and $ is for the end.

   * ^               Matches any string that starts with
   * $               Matches a string that ends with


## [Quantifiers](#table-of-contents)
    
   - Quantifiers communicate to the regex engine that it MUST match the Quanity of the character or expression  
    to its LEFT. There are two types of Quantifiers; Greedy and Lazy, each type has the same description.

    * and *? Matches Zero or more times.
    + and +? Matches One or more times.
    ? and ?? Matches Zero or One times.
    {n} and {n}? Matches exactly n times.
    {n,} and {n,}? Matches atleast n times.
    {n,m} and {n,m}? Matches from n to m times.
